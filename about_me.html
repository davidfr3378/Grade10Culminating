            <h1 id="center-h1">Who Am I?</h1>
            <p id="center-p">Hi! My name is David Ezima. I live in Stoney Creek, Ontario, and am 15 years old. I was born and raised in Nigeria (home country), and immigrated into Canada in March of year 2023.
              Now, bear in mind that I am NOT your typical 10th grader, OH HO HO, far from it. No, I donâ€™t drink whatever teenagers nowadays drink 24/7, and no, 
              I am not obsessed with social media (although I have found it to be quite entertaining (reference to Ashmal Ali)). <br> <br>
              I am farely reserved, although I come alive when I'm having fun, or observing something that interests me. People sometimes call me cynical or pessimistic, 
              but I think of my self as comical, even though my joke could potentially dry out the pacific ocean (case and point). I love learning, especially about math 
              (unfortunately primary and secondary schools don't cover some of my favourite topics, so alot of what I learn I do on my own), and the human mind 
              (why we think the way we do, morality, religion, etc.). MY love for math led me to programming, and eventually, 
              Robotics (currently a member of Bishop Ryan's Robotics team, "Celt-X") <br> <br>
              My end-goal in life has changed dramatically over the years, and will no doubt continue to change, but I know I want to study either Law, Phycology, Physics, Math and Computer Science.
              Anyone reading this is either judging my site in order to grade it, or using it as an example for html made sites, and to both parties I want to apologize for the rushed project that is this site.

            <p id="center-p">Hi! My name is Ashmal Ali. I live in Stoney Creek, Ontario, and am 14 years old. 
              Now, bear in mind that I am NOT your typical 10th grader. No, I don’t drink iced coffee 24/7, and no, 
              I am not obsessed with social media (although it is quite entertaining). <br> <br>
              I can be known as the quiet kid until you get to know me, 
              and at that point, it’s too late to deny our chaotic friendship. I would like to say I’m the definition of a Ravenclaw; clever, creative, wise,
              and more book smart than street smart. I can also be very sensitive and emotional. I’d like to say I’m an optimist, however, sometimes I can be
              a pessimist (but that’s just my inner Scorpio coming out). That’s why I love playing basketball, volleyball, and baseball. The adrenaline helps the 
              anger and stress bubbling up settle down.  <br> <br> I wouldn't say I'm the most artistic person ever, however, I frequently write poetry. In grades 7 and 8, I had
              the opportunity to go to a couple of competitions and was able to represent my school. I even won a peace award for one of my pieces called “Criticism”. 
              Writing lets me express myself and allows me to write aesthetic, powerful, and meaningful pieces of literature. <br> <br>
              My end-goal is to become a cardiologist. I believe being a doctor is one of the most rewarding jobs out there! 
              You get to save lives and could be the reason why tears of joy are shed because your patient has another opportunity to live.
              I love being the type of person who is the reason why people feel good and smile! :)</p>
